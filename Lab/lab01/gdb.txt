1.While you’re in a gdb session, how do you set the arguments that will be passed to the program when it’s run?

set args i count *p

2.How do you create a breakpoint?

break hello.c:9

3.How do you execute the next line of C code in the program after stopping at a breakpoint?

next

4.If the next line of code is a function call, you’ll execute the whole function call at once if you use your answer to #3. (If not, consider a different command for #3!) How do you tell GDB that you want to debug the code inside the function (i.e. step into the function) instead? (If you changed your answer to #3, then that answer is most likely now applicable here.)

step or s: next line, stepping into function calls

5.How do you continue the program after stopping at a breakpoint?

continue

6.How can you print the value of a variable (or even an expression like 1+2) in gdb?

print *p
print 1+2

7.How do you configure gdb so it displays the value of a variable after every step?

display *p

8.How do you show a list of all variables and their values in the current function?

info local

9.How do you quit out of gdb?

quit or q
